## Introduction

This glossary explains the core concepts behind Spectrum Suite in business terms. Whether you're evaluating why a supplier didn't match your master data, investigating data quality issues, or understanding how the platform works, this guide will help you speak the language and diagnose problems confidently.

## Entity types

**Supplier**
A business or individual you purchase goods or services from. You might match supplier invoices against your master supplier list to ensure you're paying the right vendor and to catch duplicate or variant records (e.g., "ABC Company Ltd" vs "ABC Company").

**Customer**
A business or individual you sell goods or services to. Customers are matched to standardise names, prevent duplication, and maintain accurate billing records.

**Business Unit**
A legal entity or operating division within your organisation. Business units help organise suppliers, customers, and purchases by company or location.

**Address**
A specific location associated with a supplier, customer, or business unit. Addresses are matched to identify which office or facility a transaction relates to (e.g., billing address vs. shipping address).

## Matching concepts

### What is matching?

Matching is the process of comparing a record (like an incoming invoice) against your master data to find the corresponding entity. The system scores potential matches and ranks them by confidence.

**Example:** You receive an invoice from "Smith & Co Ltd". The system searches your supplier database and finds three potential matches:
- Smith and Company Limited (score: 0.82)
- Smith Company Ltd (score: 0.76)
- Smithson Holdings (score: 0.35)

The highest-scoring match is presented first for your review.

### How matching works: two stages

Spectrum Suite uses a two-stage matching process for efficiency and accuracy:

**Stage 1: Candidate shortlisting**

Before scoring, the system shortlists candidates using key identifiers. It searches in priority order:
- Exact matches on IBAN or bank account details
- Exact matches on VAT registration number
- Exact matches on company registration number
- Exact matches on postcode
- Exact matches on email domain
- Partial name matches

If candidates are found at any level, the system stops and moves to Stage 2. This means strong identifiers (like company registration number) take priority over free-text matching.

**Stage 2: Scoring**

Once candidates are shortlisted, the system compares them to your incoming data using fuzzy matching, assigning a confidence score.

**Why this matters:** The candidate shortlisting stage dramatically improves accuracy. You're not comparing your invoice against every record in the system—you're comparing against a pre-filtered set of likely matches. This reduces false positives and speeds up processing.

### Exact matching

Exact matching finds records that match all specified criteria precisely. It's fast and has no ambiguity—if it matches, it's a guaranteed hit.

**When to use:** You have clean, structured identifiers (e.g., company registration number, IBAN).

**Example:** You know the supplier's exact company registration number. The system searches by that number and finds a single, perfect match.

**Limitation:** If the identifier is missing or incorrect, exact matching won't find the record.

### Fuzzy matching

Fuzzy matching finds records that are *similar* but not identical. The system accounts for typos, abbreviations, spacing, and variations in how names are recorded.

**When to use:** You're matching free-text fields like names or addresses where variations are expected.

**Example:** Your invoice says "Adams Manufacturing" but your master data has "Adams Mfg Ltd". Fuzzy matching finds the match despite the abbreviation difference.

**Limitation:** Fuzzy matching can occasionally return lower-confidence scores if data is noisy or unusual in format.

### Field weights

When fuzzy matching, Spectrum Suite can prioritise certain fields over others. This is called "field weighting."

**Example:** When matching suppliers by address, you might weight postcode as 40%, street name as 30%, and city as 20%, and door number as 10%. If the postcode and street match but the door number is off by 1, you still get a reasonable match because the important fields align.

## Data normalisation

Normalisation is the process of standardising data formats so comparisons are fair and consistent. Spectrum Suite applies normalisation automatically to help ensure matches are found despite minor formatting differences.

Examples include:

- **Address normalisation:** Converts spacing and punctuation to a standard format
- **Bank detail normalisation:** Removes spaces and standardises format per country (e.g., UK IBANs, sort codes)
- **Company number normalisation:** Removes country prefixes and standardises digit format
- **Phone number normalisation:** Removes formatting and converts to a standard dialling format
- **Case normalisation:** Treats "ACME CORP", "Acme Corp", and "acme corp" as equivalent

Normalisation helps, but it's not exhaustive. If your master data has fundamentally different spelling, structure, or missing information, normalisation alone won't solve it.

## Data quality fundamentals

### Garbage in, garbage out (GIGO)

The most important principle: **the quality of your matches depends on the quality of your data.**

If your master data contains:
- Fundamentally misspelled names ("Manufactura" instead of "Manufactory")
- Inconsistent data structures ("Smith & Co" stored as "Smith CO" in some records)
- Incomplete critical information (missing postal code or company number)
- Duplicates (the same vendor recorded multiple times under different names)

...then matching will struggle, and **it's not a platform problem—it's a data problem.**

### Common data quality issues

| Issue | Impact on Matching | Example | Solution |
|-------|-------------------|---------|----------|
| Fundamental spelling errors | Matches fail regardless of algorithm | "Manufactura" vs "Manufactory" | Correct source data; validate at entry point |
| Inconsistent structure | Less effective matching | "Smith & Co" recorded as "SMI CO" elsewhere | Standardise format in master data |
| Missing critical fields | Weakens candidate shortlisting | Supplier has no company number or postcode | Require key identifiers at data entry |
| Abbreviations vs. full text | May reduce confidence scores | "Intl" vs "International" in different records | Standardise to full text or abbreviations consistently |
| Duplicates in master data | Wrong match selected or multiple matches | Same vendor recorded twice under slightly different names | Audit and de-duplicate master data |
| Inconsistent field population | Some matches rely on fields you don't always have | Some suppliers have IBAN, others don't | Document data completeness; adjust matching logic |

## Match scoring and confidence

When Spectrum Suite returns a match, it assigns a **confidence score** between 0 and 1 (where 1.0 = 100% confidence) indicating how likely the match is correct.

### Understanding scores

- **0.70–1.0:** Very likely match. Safe to auto-action without review.
- **0.50–0.70:** Likely match. Recommend manual review before actioning.
- **0.30–0.50:** Possible match. Review against source data before actioning.
- **0.00–0.30:** Weak match. Discard or investigate data quality.

### Why scores vary

Scores depend on:
- **How similar the fields are** - Exact field matches score higher than partial matches
- **How many fields matched** - More matching fields = higher score
- **Field weights** - Prioritised fields contribute more to the score
- **Data normalisation** - Clean, consistently formatted data scores higher
- **Candidate stage results** - Matches found via key shortlisting (company number, postcode, etc.) typically score higher than free-text matches

## Real-world scenarios

### Scenario 1: "Why didn't this supplier match?"

**Situation:** You received an invoice from "SMC Holdings Plc" but the system couldn't match it to your master data.

**Investigation:**
1. Search your master data—is "SMC Holdings" recorded at all?
2. Check if the supplier uses a different legal name (e.g., "SMC Holdings Limited" vs "SMC Holdings Plc")
3. Check if key identifiers exist (company number, IBAN, postcode)
4. If the supplier exists but didn't match, the master data may be missing key identifiers or stored inconsistently

**Resolution:** Add "SMC Holdings Plc" as a new supplier if it's genuinely new to your system. If it exists but didn't match, add or correct key identifiers in master data.

### Scenario 2: "Why are we getting multiple matches?"

**Situation:** An invoice from "ABC Corp" returns three matches with scores in the 0.60–0.75 range.

**Investigation:**
1. Check your master data—is "ABC Corp" recorded under multiple IDs?
2. Look for slight variations: "ABC Corporation," "ABC Corp Ltd," "ABC Corp Global"
3. Determine if these are duplicates (same vendor) or different entities (different locations or divisions)

**Resolution:** If duplicates, de-duplicate your master data. If different entities, ensure they have distinct key identifiers (company number, postcode, IBAN) so the system can shortlist correctly.

### Scenario 3: "Why is matching consistently weak for this supplier?"

**Situation:** Invoices from a particular vendor consistently score 0.45–0.60 despite manual review confirming they should match.

**Investigation:**
1. Check the supplier record in master data—is information missing or inconsistent?
2. Compare incoming invoice format to master data—are names/addresses structured the same way?
3. Check if critical identifiers exist (company number, IBAN, postcode)

**Resolution:** Add missing identifiers to the master record. Standardise formatting (e.g., always use full company names, consistent address structure). If the supplier legitimately uses different names in invoices, consider adding aliases to the master record.

## When to contact your developer

**You can often solve yourself:**
- Data quality issues (duplicates, missing identifiers, inconsistent formatting)
- Asking "Is this vendor in our master data?" (audit master data)
- Comparing incoming data format to master data format (identify inconsistencies)

**Contact your developer if:**
- Match scores are consistently too low or too high across many suppliers (may indicate matching configuration needs adjustment)
- A specific entity type isn't matching at all (may indicate a system issue)
- You need to customise matching behaviour (field weights, candidate shortlisting priorities)
- Validation is rejecting data you believe to be valid (validation rules may need adjustment)
- You're unsure whether an issue is data-related or system-related

## Key takeaway

**Great matching starts with complete, consistent master data.** Spectrum Suite's two-stage matching process—candidate shortlisting followed by scoring—is designed to be forgiving of minor variations and formatting differences. However, if your master data is missing key identifiers, contains duplicates, or is structured inconsistently, no platform can overcome that. The effort you invest in data quality will pay dividends in match accuracy.
