title: 'Validate invoice line item'
openapi: 'api-reference/openapi.json POST /invoice-line-items/validate'
---

## Overview

Validates a single invoice line item against configurable business rules. Returns a list of validation issues, or an empty list if all checks pass.

**HTTP**: `POST /invoice-line-items/validate`

This endpoint requires a `Bearer` token but not `X-Tenant-Id` — validation is stateless and no data is persisted.

## Request example

```bash
curl -X POST "https://spectrumsuite.azurewebsites.net/api/invoice-line-items/validate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "invoiceLineItem": {
      "lineNumber": 1,
      "stockCode": "WIDGET-001",
      "stockDescription": "Blue Widget",
      "quantity": 10,
      "unitPrice": 25.00,
      "lineTotal": 250.00
    },
    "options": {}
  }'
```

---

## Response example

```json
{
  "data": {
    "validationIssues": []
  }
}
```

The `validationIssues` array contains any issues found. Each issue has a `validationSeverity` (`"Error"` or `"Warning"`) and a `validationMessage`.

## Invoice line item fields

All fields are optional. Provide the fields relevant to the checks you want to perform.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `lineNumber` | `integer` | Line number within the invoice. |
| `stockCode` | `string` | Your internal stock or product code. |
| `stockExternalCode` | `string` | Supplier's stock code. |
| `stockDescription` | `string` | Human-readable description of the line item. |
| `quantity` | `decimal` | Quantity invoiced. |
| `quantityUnit` | `string` | Unit of measure for the quantity (e.g., `EA`, `KG`). |
| `unitPrice` | `decimal` | Price per pricing unit. |
| `pricingUnit` | `integer` | Quantity that `unitPrice` applies to (e.g., `1`, `100`). |
| `discount1` | `decimal` | First discount amount. |
| `discount2` | `decimal` | Second discount amount. |
| `discount3` | `decimal` | Third discount amount. |
| `taxAmount` | `decimal` | Tax amount for the line. |

| `lineTotal` | `decimal` | Calculated total value of the line. |

<Note>
  No validation rules are currently enabled for invoice line items. The endpoint accepts a request and returns an empty `validationIssues` array. It exists to support future rule additions — you can integrate it now and benefit automatically when rules are released.
