title: 'Validate invoice'
openapi: 'api-reference/openapi.json POST /invoices/validate'
---

## Overview

Validates an invoice against configurable business rules. Returns a list of validation issues found, or an empty list if the invoice passes all checks.

**HTTP**: `POST /invoices/validate`

This endpoint requires a `Bearer` token but not `X-Tenant-Id` — validation is stateless and no data is persisted.

## Request example

```bash
curl -X POST "https://spectrumsuite.azurewebsites.net/api/invoices/validate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "invoice": {
      "reference": "INV-2025-001",
      "totalNetAmount": 1000.00,
      "totalTaxAmount": 200.00,
      "totalGrossAmount": 1250.00,
      "currency": "GBP"
    },
    "options": {
      "validateTotals": true
    }
  }'
```

---

## Response example

```json
{
  "data": {
    "validationIssues": [
      {
        "validationSeverity": "Error",
        "validationMessage": "Total net amount + total tax amount does not equal total gross amount."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

An empty `validationIssues` array means the invoice passed all validation checks. Each issue has a `validationSeverity` of `"Error"` or `"Warning"` and a `validationMessage` describing the problem.
