title: 'Query external items (paginated)'
openapi: 'api-reference/openapi.json GET /external-items'
---

Returns external item records using the standard [paginated query](/api-reference/common-paginated-query) pattern. External items are a **read-only** aggregate view joining purchase order lines with receipt lines, providing a consolidated view of ordered, received, and invoiced quantities.

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/external-items`

## External item-specific notes

- External items are **read-only** — they cannot be imported directly. They are derived from [Query purchase order lines (paginated)](/api-reference/purchase-order-lines/query) and [Query receipt lines (paginated)](/api-reference/receipt-lines/query).
