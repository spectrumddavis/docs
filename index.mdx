## Key capabilities

**Entity matching**
- Match customers, suppliers, business units, and addresses across disparate data sources
- Choose between exact matching and configurable fuzzy matching with field-level weights
- Normalise addresses, bank details, and company numbers for stronger matches

**Data validation**
- Validate invoices and line items with configurable tolerance levels
- Enforce business rules and catch data quality issues before they propagate downstream
- Run validation as part of import workflows or independently

**Batch import**
- Efficiently upsert records in bulk using optimised SQL operations
- Import from any system via REST API—no custom connectors needed
- Aggregate import results and handle errors gracefully

**Multi-tenant architecture**
- Complete data isolation per tenant
- Identity and authorisation integrated with Azure Entra ID
- Perfect for shared platforms and distributed teams

## Who uses Spectrum Suite

Spectrum Suite is built for **teams integrating data across systems**—you might be a developer configuring API tasks in Therefore™, building capture workflows in ABBYY Vantage, or orchestrating processes in Toca®.

Whatever your role, this documentation is designed to help you understand the platform, integrate confidently, and troubleshoot issues.
